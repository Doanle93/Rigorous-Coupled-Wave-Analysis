# Rigorous-Coupled-Wave-Analysis
semi-analytic fourier series solutions for Maxwell's equations

## First TMM
TMM is usually the 'intellectual' precursor to RCWA. It assumes different layers but each layer has no structure (could be anisotropic however)

## Transitioning to RCWA
RCWA is really TMM but we need to semi-analytically deal with an inhomogeneous medium
